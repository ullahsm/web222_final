						<strong>
						Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</strong><br>
						Responsive design in easy terms means 'Flexible Design'. It is a method of creating web pages that uses flexible layouts, graphics, and media queries in the form of cascading style sheets. The purpose of responsive design is to create web pages that recognize the size and orientation of the visitor's screen and dynamically adjusts the layout accordingly.
						<br><br>
						Responsive web design relieves web designers from working day and night creating websites for every single different device. With responsive design, web designers can now create one site that dynamically changes it's layout and makes it a fit for all solution.
						<br><br><br>
						<strong>
						How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
						</strong><br>
						Responsive design is the process of creating online properties that are adapted to the device on which they are viewed. The most typical way is to define it on mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets, and then scale it up to larger screens
						<br><br>
						People are increasingly accessing the internet through their smartphones and tablets, driving the use of responsive design in web apps. Touchscreens, GPS data, accelerometers, and other features not present on desktops and laptops may also be found on mobile devices. When viewing a website on a mobile or tablet device, the appearance varies dynamically depending on the screen size and orientation of the device. The method used to make this happen is Responsive Web Design (RWD).
						<br><br>
						A responsive web design allows a website to change to the size of the screen on which it is being viewed. On a smartphone, your website will seem significantly different than it does on a laptop or desktop computer. The website is automatically adjusted depending on the device to provide the user a better experience. Responsive design also examines the interaction that will make your site easier to use by using elements such as touch screens and unique mobile-assisted navigation. Providing a positive user experience and enhancing accessibility are found to be the most significant benefits of this method.
						<br><br><br>
						<strong>
						What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?
						</strong><br>
						There is an app for everything nowadays, but users every user struggle with storage concerns because as a typical mobile app weigh around 20MB (evontech.com, 2015). Due to the lack of storage capacity on mobile devices, it is impossible for a user to install every mobile app that looks to be useful for them. A web app is an ideal alternative in such scenario as it is only 1/20th the size of a mobile app and can be accessed quickly by simply typing a URL into a browser. A web app's URL can also be bookmarked for future usage, so users don't even need to remember it.
						<br><br>
						Moreover, businesses can save big bucks by using a web app since they don't have to build hefty, updated versions of mobile applications, and users don't have to upgrade their mobile apps as often. As a result, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to state that web apps benefit both owners and users.
						<br><br>
						Furthermore, it is easier to make a web app adaptable to smaller and larger screens and requires less effort, giving it a massive advantage over mobile apps.
						<br><br><br>
						<strong>
						Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.
						</strong><br>
						WEB222 was, without a doubt, one of my most favorite courses by far. I had basic understanding of web development from before, but I believe I now have a better comprehension after taking this course. My goal for this course was to improve my understanding of all web technologies, particularly JavaScript, which I feel I have accomplished.
						<br><br>
						Aside from the course materials, I thought the manner this course was taught to be quite successful, and I am sure other students felt the same way. There were several instances addressed in class, as well as extensive learning materials were provided, which I found to be quite beneficial. Overall, I found the course to be a really enjoyable learning experience.
